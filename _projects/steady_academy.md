Steady Academy is a learning management website that provides users with access to educational resources. That project was Inspired by Udemy and BasicSchool and was build to help friends who had difficulty learning due to the pandemic. I led a team of 6 members and was also responsible for helping with Flutter for the UI. The repository project is on my github at <a href="https://github.com/Djebreds" target="_blank" class="text-cv-blue-primary-dark">https://github.com/Djebreds/</a>
